This folder contains the GCMC simulation code for running the "fixed obstacle simulations" introduced in the maintext, at specified Jm, Jp, fo (0, 0.1,0.2,0.3), with l=5, ht=1 and tether fraction=0.1 (number of tethers divided by the total number of lipids).

The code for excuting the GCMC simulation is contained in the file "9mer_memb_simu_obstacle.py".

Simulation could be run with the example command provided in "tethnn0_memb_9mer_simu_-19_0.1_40_30_0.1_1_0.3_0.1.sh", where  Jb, Jmemb and Jteth correspond to Jp, Jm and ht introduced in the paper respectively.

Simulation data will be saved to the folder (named according to the parameter values specified) generated by running the code.
