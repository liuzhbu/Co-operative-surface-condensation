This folder contains the GCMC simulation code for running the tether and obstacle free simulations at specified Jm, Jp, fA and ht, with l=5.

The code for excuting the GCMC simulation is contained in the file "9mer_memb_simu_noteth_pickup.py".

Simulation could be run with the example command provided in "noteth_memb_9mer_simu_-19_1.0_40_30_0.2_1.0_A0.1.sh", where  Jb, Jmemb, Jteth and lipAfrac correspond to Jp, Jm, ht and fA introduced in the paper respectively.

Simulation data will be saved to the folder (named according to the parameter values specified) generated by running the code.
