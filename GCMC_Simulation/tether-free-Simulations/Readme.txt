This folder contains the GCMC simulation code for running the tether and obstacle free simulations at specified Jm, Jp, fA (0.01, 0.0175, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3), l and ht introduced in the maintext.

The code for excuting the GCMC simulation is contained in the file "9mer_memb_simu_noteth_pickup.py".

Simulation could be run with the example command provided in "noteth_memb_9mer_simu_-19_0.1_40_30_0.1_1_A0.1_t5.sh", where  Jb, Jmemb, Jteth, tethrlength and lipAfrac correspond to Jp, Jm, ht, l and fA introduced in the paper respectively.

Simulation data will be saved to the folder (named according to the parameter values specified) generated by running the code.
